# Onboarding System Documentation

## Overview

A comprehensive onboarding system designed specifically for pornography addiction recovery. The system uses 12 psychologically-crafted questions to assess user risk levels and provide personalized motivation for maximum conversion rates.

## Architecture

### Core Components

1. **OnboardingModels.swift** - Data structures for questions, options, responses, and user profiles
2. **OnboardingManager.swift** - Business logic and state management
3. **OnboardingQuestionView.swift** - Individual question UI component
4. **OnboardingView.swift** - Main navigation controller
5. **OnboardingCompletionView.swift** - Personalized completion screen

### Key Features

- **Progressive Assessment**: 12 carefully designed questions targeting core addiction pain points
- **Risk Scoring**: Automated assessment based on user responses
- **Personalized Messaging**: Tailored completion messages based on risk level
- **Smooth Animations**: Professional UI transitions matching app design
- **Persistent State**: Onboarding completion status saved to UserDefaults
- **Debug Support**: Reset functionality for development testing

## Question Strategy

### Psychological Targeting

The questions are strategically designed to:

1. **Establish Pain Points** (Questions 1-3): Frequency, compulsive behavior, time investment
2. **Highlight Life Impact** (Questions 4-6): Work/school, relationships, self-worth
3. **Identify Triggers** (Questions 7-8): Stress, boredom patterns
4. **Assess Recovery History** (Questions 9-12): Previous attempts, motivation, support, tools

### Conversion Optimization

- **Immediate Pain Recognition**: Questions force users to confront the reality of their addiction
- **Progressive Revelation**: Each question builds on the previous to create mounting awareness
- **Hope Integration**: Later questions focus on recovery potential and available support
- **Personalized Validation**: Completion message acknowledges their specific struggle level

## Technical Implementation

### Data Flow

```
App Launch → OnboardingManager checks completion status
↓
If incomplete → OnboardingView displays questions sequentially
↓
User responses → Stored in OnboardingProfile with risk calculation
↓
Final question → OnboardingCompletionView with personalized message
↓
Completion → Main app with full feature access
```

### Risk Scoring Algorithm

- **Question Weights**: More critical questions (life impact) have higher multipliers
- **Option Weights**: More severe responses contribute more to risk score
- **Personalized Messaging**: 4 tiers of messaging based on final risk score
- **Therapeutic Approach**: Higher risk scores receive more supportive, understanding messages

### UI Design Principles

- **Consistent Branding**: Uses app's existing Theme system and color palette
- **Accessibility**: Large touch targets, clear typography, high contrast
- **Progress Indication**: Visual progress bar with smooth animations
- **Emotional Design**: Colors and animations designed to be calming, not triggering
- **Mobile Optimization**: Responsive design for various screen sizes

## Usage

### First-Time Users
- Automatic presentation on app launch
- Cannot skip or bypass the assessment
- Smooth transition to main app upon completion

### Development/Testing

### Customization

The system is highly customizable:
